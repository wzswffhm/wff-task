# trial-costs

Sum agent-trial spend from TB3 PR comments (`/run` and `/cheat` trial-result tables).

## Usage

```bash
uv run scripts/trial-costs/trial_costs.py              # last 7 days
uv run scripts/trial-costs/trial_costs.py --days 30
uv run scripts/trial-costs/trial_costs.py --since 2026-05-01
uv run scripts/trial-costs/trial_costs.py --top-threshold 50
```

## What it reports

- Total spend across all providers
- Split by kind (`/run` vs `/cheat`)
- Split by provider (anthropic, openai, google, gemini, …) and by kind × provider
- Top-spender PRs above `--top-threshold` (default $100)
- Per-task latest `/run` trial cost (one row per PR, most recent comment), with per-provider breakdown

Cost is parsed from trial-result tables — both `$X.YY` dollar cells and `X.Y¢` cent cells. Provider is the prefix before `/` in the model id (e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` → `anthropic`).
