# Review-by-domain chart

Generates a treemap SVG of the tasks currently merged into `main` (under `tasks/`),
grouped by the seven task-domain **categories** and their
**subcategories**.

Classification is **deterministic**: each task's `category` and `subcategory` are
read straight from its `task.toml` `[metadata]`. There is no model call at chart
time. The taxonomy itself is documented in
[`TAXONOMY.md`](../../docs/TAXONOMY.md), and CI
(`scripts/checks/check-task-fields.sh`) enforces that every task carries a valid
`category` + non-empty `subcategory`.

The SVG is published to a `chart` branch and embedded in the README via its raw URL.

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `generate_chart.py` | Reads `category`/`subcategory` from every `task.toml`, renders the treemap SVG. |
| `media/` | Output: `tb-domains.svg` + `cache.json` (gitignored on main). |

In CI, the SVG and `cache.json` live at `media/` on the `chart` branch.

## CLI

```bash
# Render the chart to the default out dir (media/, gitignored)
uv run scripts/diagrams/generate_chart.py

# Render to a custom location, with a per-domain count summary
uv run scripts/diagrams/generate_chart.py --out /tmp/chartout -v
```

No API key or network access is required. Tasks whose `task.toml` has a `category`
that is not one of the seven domains, or no `subcategory`, are dropped from the
chart with a warning to stderr (CI's `check-task-fields.sh` prevents this for
merged tasks).

## Outputs

- `tb-domains.svg` — the treemap.
- `cache.json` — `dirname -> {category, subcategory}` for every charted task, for reference.

## CI workflow

`.github/workflows/build-domain-chart.yml` rebuilds the chart on every push to
`main` that touches `tasks/**` or `scripts/diagrams/**` — i.e. whenever a
task is merged (plus manual `workflow_dispatch`). The job commits the regenerated
SVG + `cache.json` to `media/` on the `chart` branch; the README's `<img>` points at the raw
URL on that branch. No repo secrets are required.
