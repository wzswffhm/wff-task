    A miss is reported by returning the ``default`` object handed to ``get``, never by
    raising. The enforcer passes a private sentinel as ``default``, so an implementation
    that returns it verbatim on a miss can cache ``False`` and ``None`` values safely.

    Implementations are expected to be safe to call from several threads at once, since
    a single enforcer may be shared between them.
