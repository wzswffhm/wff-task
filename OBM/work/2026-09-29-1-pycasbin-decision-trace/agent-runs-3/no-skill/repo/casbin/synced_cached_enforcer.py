    enforce() runs under the read lock, and serving it from the cache also writes to the
    cache, so several readers can be storing decisions at once. That is safe because the
    cache does its own locking -- see casbin.cache.DefaultCache. A cache installed through
    set_cache() has to offer the same guarantee.

    Policy changes take the write lock, and invalidation happens inside that same call, so
    no reader can observe a mutated policy alongside a pre-mutation cache entry.
